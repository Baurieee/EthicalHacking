# Repository

This repository contains writeups created during the **Ethical Hacking** course. The goal is to keep a single place with repeatable lab steps, common commands, and short explanations that are useful during red team exercises (including the final attack–defense lab 🟥🟦).

## Repository structure

- `exercises/`  
  Contains Markdown writeups for hands-on labs completed during the **Ethical Hacking** course.  
  Each file is a standalone writeup with:
  - brief context (what the lab demonstrates)
  - main commands/payloads used
  - expected results / observations
  - short notes (impact, common mistakes, defensive takeaway)
- `detection/`  
  Contains Markdown writeups for hands-on labs from **Ethical Hacking** course from the **Cyberprotection systems** course perspective. 

## Disclaimer
These notes are for **educational purposes** only. 😊😊😊
